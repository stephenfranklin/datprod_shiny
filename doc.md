This interactive Shiny application performs machine learning algorithms to predict species of lillies (from the lily dataset).

The data is divided into two sets, one for training the algorithm and the other for testing it. The algorithm is run upon any change in the two user controls.

#### Training Percentage:
Use the slider to choose the percentage of data that goes to the training set (the rest will go to the testing set).

#### Model method:
Choose one of two algorithms, CART or Random Forest.

#### Tabbed Panel
The tabs display a summary of the trained fit, a table of the results of tested predictions, and a plot of tested predictions, and this document.
